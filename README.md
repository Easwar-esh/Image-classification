# Image-classification
Image classification plays a crucial role in a variety of applications, from self-driving cars and medical diagnosis to facial recognition and content filtering. CNNs are particularly well-suited for image classification tasks, as they can learn complex patterns and features in images and produce highly accurate predictions. By working on hands-on projects in image classification, you will gain valuable experience in applying machine learning techniques to real-world problems.
